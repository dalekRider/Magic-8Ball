<h2>JavaScript Magic 8Ball - WIP</h2>

<p>Hellooooo, Confused about what to do? Making the tough decisions causing the old cortex fits? Try this Magic 8-Ball Script! Slap it into console and call up the old magicEightBallSays(); and let JavaScrip decide your fate!
  
This script was created while going through the numerous JavaScript courses out there. This particular course was created by <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. At this time I have uploaded two script files.

The first file is the solution used to complete the project in Codecademy's workspace. I was attempting to use a prompt(); in their workspace but kept getting an error thrown at me about prompt not being defined which was odd. I took the script and slapped it in Chrome's console and no issues. As it turns out their workspace environment for this project (not sure about others), uses node.js which caused the error due to no window level. <em>I think that is how I understood the conflict</em>. So with that being said the solution version will work inside of their workspace.

The second version is a more interactive iteration of the script. I wrapped it up in a simple function and made some changes to give it more of an interactive feel. This version uses prompts for input and alerts for output. <strong>This</strong> is the version that I will be tinkering with and updating.

<strong>Possible Upcoming Changes and Improvements:</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li>Use forms instead of prompts</li>
  <li>Responses returned through updated DOM on page instead of alerts</li>
  <li><del>Styled Page</del></li>
  <li><del>Eliminate need for console</del></li>
  <li>Possible Animations</li>
  <li>Possibly allow option to change theme based responses (ex: Klingon, Cat, Bromodo Dragon...)</li>
</ul>
<br />

Thanks for looking and Good luck out there!</p>

<h4>Update 1/15/2018</h4>

Created a minimally style index page to run the script. I added an event listener to a button to call the script. It currently still used prompts and alerts but this will change over time.
