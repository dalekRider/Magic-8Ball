        <h2>How did you?</h2>
        <p> This page was created after completing a CodeCademy's "Magic-8Ball" Project. The original code for completing that project is available at my <a href="https://github.com/dalekRider/Magic-8Ball">Github Repo</a>.</p>
        <p>There have been 3 versions of this project. The first was a simple run in console only script. The second version made the project slightly more interactive by including prompts and alerts. The recent version uses a similar script, with some changes.</p>
        <p>The final iteration still uses a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch" target="_blank">switch statement</a> and a random number generator to determine the final outcome, however it now uses a form and displays results in the DOM. Additionally the page is built using new CSS Grid techniques and the final output will include fallback support for users not using current browsers. </p>
        <p>This script and page is still being refactored and will be updated soon, to make better use of the form, add fallback support. I was going to add a build version with my gulp starter kit, but I've decided to add those from the start of a project or when a complete overhaul is needed.</p>
